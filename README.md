# Nodes
This is a node-collection for ComfyUI. I will share whatever reasonable thing I create here.

## Save Text File
This is a copy and refactor from the Save Text File-node from the https://github.com/YMC-GitHub/ymc-node-suite-comfyui pack. I needed it to provide an output file for ease of use, so I updated it to do so.
The bottom pin outputs both the input text, but also the delimiter and the padded number. This can be useful to name files and write to text-files for automatic captioning.
