# Nodes for ComfyUI

This repository hosts a collection of nodes developed for ComfyUI. It aims to share useful components that enhance the functionality of ComfyUI projects.

## 💾 Save Text File With Path Node

This node is adapted and enhanced from the Save Text File node found in the [YMC GitHub ymc-node-suite-comfyui pack](https://github.com/YMC-GitHub/ymc-node-suite-comfyui). It was modified to output a file for easier usability. The output pin now includes the input text along with a delimiter and a padded number, offering a versatile solution for file naming and automatic text file generation for captions.

## 🖼️ Download Image from URL Node

This node downloads an image from an URL and lets you use it.

It also outputs the Width/Height of the image.

* By default, it will save the image to the /input directory.
  * Clear the `save_path` line to prevent saving the image (it will still be saved in the TEMP-folder).
* If you enter a name in the `save_file_name_override` section, the file will be saved with this name.
  * You can enter or ignore the file extension.
  * If you enter one, it will rename the file to the chosen extension without converting the image.
* Supported image formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP.
* Does not support saving with transparency.

## ✨ Groq LLM API Node

## ⛔ Generate Negative Prompt Node

> [!CAUTION]
> This node is highly experimental, and does not produce any useful result right now. It also requires you to download a specially trained model for it. It's just not worth the effort. It's mostly here to share a work in progress project.

This node utilizes a GPT-2 text inference model to generate a negative prompt that is supposed to enhance the aspects of the positive prompt.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Installation Step:**
> Download the [weights.pt file](https://huggingface.co/mnemic/NegativePromptGenerator/blob/main/weights.pt) from the project's [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/mnemic/NegativePromptGenerator/tree/main).
>
> Place the `weights.pt` file in the following directory of your ComfyUI setup without renaming it:
> ```
> \ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-mnemic-nodes\nodes\negativeprompt
> ```
> The directory should resemble the following structure:
